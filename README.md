# Monte-Carlo
Shows a visualisation of the Monte Carlo approximation for pi. Written in Python 3.9 but it should hopefully work in newer versions of Python.

**Note: The code is poorly written because it was done quickly, it could 100% be optimized but I don't see a need to do that right now**
# Usage
You just need to download and run the file, the only requirement is matplotlib. If you don't currently have that then download both files, go into the directory and run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The limit for the number of points is set to 1000 but this can be changed by going into the file and changing the variable "pointlimit".
